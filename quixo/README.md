# Quixo
Quixo is a two player game.

## Rules
The game is played on a 5x5 board. Each player has 5 pieces, either X or O. The players take turns moving their pieces. A piece can be moved by sliding it in a row or column. The piece can be moved as far as possible in the chosen direction, until it reaches the edge of the board or another piece. The player who moves their pieces to form a line of 5 pieces wins the game.
